# Quizzler
Hey, I hope you are doing amazing. So for today I built this Quizzler Quiz Game using the Open Trivia Database API and the tkinter module  in Python during my 100 Days of Code Course. It's a simple quiz game with a right and wrong button. It tracks your score too. It is a simple game to play consisting of 10 questions. Have a quiz around and let me know. Thank You.
